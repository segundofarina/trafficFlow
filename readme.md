# Traffic Flow simulation
This is the fianl project for Similacion de Sistemas. We will implement the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg theorethicasl model for 
simulating a free way traffic.

## Data analysis 
### Closed system (periodic)
* Analyze with only one lane ,periodic and  varying densities the  traffic flow of the system
    * Graph of density vs flow
    * Graph of ocuppancy vs flow
    
### Open System 
     
### Intresection
     
### Extending to multiple lanes

* Analyze the effect of lane merging  
### Self-Driving cars
* Elimintae the human distraction factor and compare the results aginst one with human distractions
