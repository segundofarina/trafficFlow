# Traffic Flow simulation
This is the final project for Simulacion de Sistemas. In this project we implement the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg theorethical model with the goal of simulating a free way traffic.

## Data analysis 
### Closed system (periodic)
* Analyze with only one lane, periodic and varying densities the traffic flow of the system:
    * Graph of density vs flow
    * Graph of ocuppancy vs flow
    
### Open System 
     
### Intresection
* Analyze flow with and without stop-lights.
     
### Extending to multiple lanes

* Analyze the effect of lane merging and lane switching.

### Self-Driving cars
* Eliminate the human distraction factor and compare the results against one with human distractions.
